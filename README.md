## Description

I wanted to learn more about creating things from the back end through the terminal
Aside from this being part of an assignment, this piqued my interest as it feels like a next step beyond the last assignment.
it creates a new SVG out of thin air that you can make as a logo. It looks bad yeah but it can be much better once you get the concept.
I learned about the usage of JEST and testing these functions to see if it would work. I also learned about classes and switch

## Installation

clone through the github, download the necessary JEST and inquirer files. Then run them through the terminal

## Usage

type in node index.js and answer the questions, to test it, run npm test on the terminal
